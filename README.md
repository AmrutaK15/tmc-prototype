# tmc-prototype
This is the repository for TMC evolutionary prototype. The prototype aims to realize Telescope Monitoring and Control functionality, and utilizes the platform, tools and technology specified for the SKA construction. The prototype utilizes the base classes created in-line with the SKA Control System Guidelines and Tango coding standards.

## Prototype Scope
The design for the  TMC prototype (Stage I) is targeting the following functionality and architectural aspects:
### Functionality
* [ ] Monitoring and control functionality with hierarchy of nodes
* [x] LMC simulator for Dish
* [ ] Subarray creation using static configuration 
* [x] Command and response mechanism
* [x] Group command 
* [ ] Alarm detection and handling 
### Architecture
* [ ] Hierarchy of control nodes - Central node, Subarray node, Leaf Node
* [x] Interface between the TMC and Element LMC
* [ ] Use of Element Alarm Handler and Central Alarm Handler
* [ ] Use of Element Logger and Central Logger
* [x] Use of base classes for development of control nodes and LMC simulators
### Other (Tools/Technology/Framework)
* Linux/Ubuntu (16.04 LTS)
* Tango
* PyTango 
* Elettra, PANIC
* Pytest

## Install
TMC prototype (Stage I) includes the developement of Control Nodes and Dish Master Simulator. Installation steps for the Control nodes and Dish Master Simulator are provided in respective folders.

## Testing
Unit test cases are needed to be developed for testing of the Control Nodes and Dish Master Simulator.
